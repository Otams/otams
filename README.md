## About Me 🚀

I'm a passionate **Data Scientist / Backend Developer-in-training** with a background in **Mechatronics Engineering**. I specialize in using **Python, SQL, and Power BI** to derive insights, build predictive models, and solve real-world problems. I'm currently enrolled in the ALX Backend Pro Developer course to deepen my software engineering skills and gain the ability to build and deploy full-stack applications.

- 🌱 Currently learning: **Backend Development (ALX), API design, Django, Deployment**
- 🔭 Working on: **A portfolio of 60+ data science & backend projects + a UAV object detection model**
- 🌍 Languages: **Python, SQL, JavaScript (learning), English, Igbo**
- 📫 How to reach me: **otamiritriumph@gmail.com**
- ⚡ Fun fact: **I once ran a CoreDAO campaign at an NYSC camp with over 1,200 attendees!**
